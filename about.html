   <p class="aboutMe">
    Hi, My name is Kiran Bishop and I am a rising junior at Sidwell Friends School in Washington DC. I created this website during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in 2022.</p>
  <p class="aboutMe">  
     I am very passionate about this subject because overuse of social media has effected me. Social media usage has permeated every aspect of my life, and it would not be outrageous to say that I am on my phone almost constantly. I hope that by creating this website I can not only educate other teenagers on the detriments of too much social media use, but also educate myself and use it as a motivator to change my everyday habits.
